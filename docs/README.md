## Requirements

```
streamlit
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
tensorflow
xgboost
lightgbm
joblib
openpyxl
plotly
reportlab
llama-cpp-python (optional, for Chat Assistant feature)
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-xpert.git
   cd ml-xpert
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) For the Chat Assistant feature, install llama-cpp-python:
   ```bash
   pip install llama-cpp-python
   ```
   
   For GPU acceleration (recommended):
   ```bash
   pip install llama-cpp-python --prefer-binary --extra-index-url=https://pypi.anaconda.org/scipy-wheels-nightly/simple
   ```

4. Download a Llama model:
   - Get a GGUF format Llama model (recommended: llama-3.2-8b-instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf)
   - Place it in a directory of your choice
   - See [llama_setup_guide.md](llama_setup_guide.md) for detailed instructions

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Navigate through the different sections:
   - Start by uploading your dataset in the **Data Loading** section
   - Process your data using the **Data Processing** tools
   - Explore your data with the **EDA** tools
   - Train models using either **ML Model Training** or **DL Model Training** sections
   - Evaluate your models' performance in the **Evaluate** section
   - Generate reports in the **Report** section
   - Ask questions about ML concepts in the **ML Chat Assistant** section

## Chat Assistant

The ML Chat Assistant feature provides an interactive way to learn about machine learning concepts through natural language conversation. It uses a locally running Llama 3.2 model to answer your ML-related questions.

### Setup

1. Install llama-cpp-python (see Installation section above)
2. Download a Llama 3.2 model in GGUF format
3. In the Chat Assistant section, configure the model settings:
   - Set the path to your model file
   - Adjust parameters like GPU layers, context length, and batch size
   - Click "Load Model" to initialize the chat

### Usage Tips

- Ask specific questions about machine learning concepts
- Use the chat to guide your understanding of model selection and evaluation
- Clear the chat history when starting a new topic
- If you encounter memory issues, reduce the context length or batch size

## CNN Image Classification

The CNN section allows you to:

1. Upload and preprocess image datasets
2. Visualize sample images from your dataset
3. Train CNN models with customizable architectures
4. Evaluate model performance on test data
5. Make predictions on new images
